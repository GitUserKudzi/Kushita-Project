# Kushita-Project
E-commerce website

This website/web app is designed to have a personalised experience when shopping.
It is done by allowing users called "shop owners" to have a profile that has all the items that they sell to be listed under they're shop name
The items will be listed in form of pictures displaying the items
The other party involved are clients or customers called "customers"
They will be given the privilege to browse through the shop owner's items called "catalogues", using various filters such as item type, price and geographical location
Shop owners will then be asked to provide images of the inventory that they previously had in order to show what they are capable of providing. This is done to help them improve they're credibility which will be reflected in the rating system.
